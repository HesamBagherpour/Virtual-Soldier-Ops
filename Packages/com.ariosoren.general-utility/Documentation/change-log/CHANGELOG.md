# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


<!-- 

Guiding Principles:
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Types of changes:
- Added         for new features.
- Changed       for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated    for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed       for now removed features.
- Fixed         for any bug fixes.
- Security      in case of vulnerabilities.

----------------------------------------------------------------

> How can I reduce the effort required to maintain a changelog?
Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:

People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
At release time, you can move the `Unreleased` section changes into a new release version section.
